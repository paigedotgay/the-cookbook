my old cookbook was made for gitbook but they don't support gitbook-cli anymore so I'm just doing markdown. I may pretty it up later.

I make changes to these recipes all the time while cooking, and mostly use this as a guide to point me in the right direction. I encourage you to do the same.

Because of the above point there isn't a lot of quantities listed for ingredients, I use as much as I think I'll need, you should do the same.

I hate recipe guides that give you a life story before getting to the ingredients.
You will not find that here.
