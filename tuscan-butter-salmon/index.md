# Notes
This Recipe is from [Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a58412/tuscan-butter-salmon-recipe/)

I usually add some pre-made mushroom filled ravioli, sometimes I skip the salmon and just use the sauce for the raviolis

# Ingredients
- Olive Oil (to cook the salmon)
- 2 8oz center cut salmon slices, salted and peppered
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 1 thinly sliced shallot
- 3 cloves garlic (1 Tbsp jarlic)
- 1 1/2 cups quartared and salted campari tomatoes
- 2 cups baby spinach (I usually cut them even smaller)
- 3/4 cups heavy cream
- 1/4 cup grated parmesean
- 1/8 cup dried basil
- lemon juice

# Prep
- Salt and pepper your salmon on both sides
- Slice your shallots thin
- Quarter your tomatoes, salt them
- Chop your spinach if you like
- Grate your parmesean
- Start boiling a pot of water

# Cooking
1. Add a small amount of oil to a high walled pan and heat on low-medium heat until shimmering
2. Add salmon to pan, skin side up, cook for about 6 minutes, slightly lower the heat and flip, cook for 4 minutes.
3. Remove the salmon and add to a plate once cooked
4. Add your butter to the pan, if the butter cooks too fast you can remove it from the heat, don't break the butter.
5. Once the butter melts add your shallot, cook until turning translucent, then add garlic, cook for about 1 more minute
6. Add your tomatoes, cook until the skin starts getting wrinkly, do not crush the tomatoes
7. Add your spinach, cook until dark green and slightly wilted
8. Add your cream and most of the parmesean,let it simmer, tilt the pan to one side to add a slice of salmon with no solids beneath it, repeat with your other slice
9. Simmer for a few minutes while you cook your ravioli, usually around 4 minutes
10. Plate, top the ravioli with the sauce and remaining parmesean
