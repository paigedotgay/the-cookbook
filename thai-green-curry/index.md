# Notes
This recipe is from [_The Essential Asian Cookbook._](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Essential_Asian_Cookbook.html?id=7i7XPAAACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)

# Ingredients
- Oil
- 1 Onion
- 1-2 Tbsp Green Curry Paste (I use Mae Ploy)
- 1 1/2 Cup Coconut Milk (usually 1 can)
- 1/2 Cup Water
- 1lb Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs (breasts will work, just don't overcook them)
- __Fresh__ Green Beans, About Half a Handfull
- 6 Kaffir Lime Leaves (hard to find, I usually get it from Asian grocery stores, but it isn't super required)
- 1 Tbsp Fish Sauce
- 1 Lime
- 2 tsp Brown Sugar
- 1/4 Cup Cilantro Leaves
- Your Preferred Rice (I do 3 servings of Basmatti rice, but the servings on my rice cooker are kinda big)

# Prep
- You will need a tall pan or pot
- Zest and juice the lime
- Dice the onion
- Cut the green beans in half or thirds, small enough you can fit into your mouth easy
- Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces
- If you're using canned coconut milk make sure the can is open before you start cooking
- You may find it useful to wrap the leaves in twine or add to a tea steeper for easy retrieval, I am not smart enough to do this beforehand
- You will need a way to cook rice, once everything else is prepped, but before you start cooking the curry start cooking your rice as it can take some time

# Cooking
1. Add oil to your pot, just enough to coat the bottom. Once warm add your onion and curry paste, cook for about a minute before adding the coconut milk and water. Boil.
2. Add the chicken, green beans, and lime leaves to the pot. Stir and reduce heat to medium low, simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Add the fish sauce, lime juice and zest, and brown sugar, stir.
4. Fish out the lime leaves, and serve on top of rice, sprinkle with the cilantro.
